# todo2017
A todo list application built incrementally in tiny steps.

Welcome to todo2017 an application that I have started but never completed enough times that I have given up using new names, I am just incrementing based on year.

This repo will incrementally build a todo list application which includes a mySql database, website, API, and likely an Android application.

The initial code will be written in Python with Flask being added as it gets web accessiable. 

The current state of mind dictates that I build mico incrementally, literally aim for very few lines of change between commits with MANY commits. We will see.

Obviously writing long strings, such as README updates, doesn't count on the 'fewest lines of change' front.
